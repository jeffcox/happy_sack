Once upon a time I found a great fork of sack that worked in my environment, then it got deleted.

This is that fork.  Intended purely for my personal use, I will be making small updates and changes.

Advantages over the main project:

* Simpler use and configuration, no profiles
* Works on macOS, FreeBSD, and Linux
